Whether it is r/BernieSanders, r/ourpressident, r/conservatives, r/politics(it is 90% biased to dems be real), r/AOC and so on. Look I am not against fans of the people. But the amount of just false info or purposefully misleading info I see on the front page alone on these subreddits is absolutely insane. And I guarantee fans of these reedits will claim their subreddit doesn't do this. IT DOES. As an active fan of r/yangforpresidenthq the amount of circle jerking is insane. They are small so the misleading isn't rampant like r/politics, but one day if it grows it will get there. \n\nSadly Reddit is extremely Democratic and it artificially creates more democratic circle jerking and bias. And redditors act like it is because dems are always right. Reality is the country is nearly split in 1/2 and reddit is more like 10/90 which is very unhealthy. Honestly there needs to be some way to moderate in more conservative takes and in a fair way. Because they do have a point many times. Hell I got banned from r/ourpresident for disagreeing a wealth tax(which there are legit concerns that people are not allowed to discuss on reddit in fear of bans). Legit I didn't even say bad words or anything hating Bernie who ironically is not our president. They just refuse outside info. \n\nTo be clear as I said I am an Andrew Yang fan, I am by no means republican. My favorite presidents vary from dem to republican. And personally I identify as Independent. Personally I view picking sides as pure stupidity. No offense to you who do. (I say all this before the comment hating me for being a rep, even though I'm not)\n\nTo further my point I just got banned on r/politics for this exact comment copy pasted below. Apparently it is hate speech you read yourself. It was on banning the electoral college. I did 0 editing here and on comment and also had an upvote, 1, but still someone agreed with me I was not negative just mods disagree with me and want to circle jerk. yes Environments is spelled wrong, like I said no editing. \n\n \"I actually disagree with this. The electoral college is the only way the smaller farmer or rural districts can get any representation in the executive branch. Which would mean democrats will basically always control the executive branch. To me this is a big step in a way to reduce fairness in elections. Even the founding fathers knew this and put the electoral college in place to protect against this, and also to outweigh the poor, which is sad, but it does genuinely protect those in rural enviorments.\""

            "There's actually a way to force the Senate to vote on saving net neutrality. It's called the Congressional Review Act. Under this law, Congress can block any agency decision by passing a resolution of disapproval in both chambers. This resolution cannot be filibustered in the Senate and only 30 senators need to sign a petition to force a vote.\n\nEd Markey has already said he'll introduce a CRA resolution: https://twitter.com/ACLU_Mass/status/940251501695590405\n\nSusan Collins supports net neutrality. If Doug Jones wins tomorrow, that would mean only one other Republican senator would need to flip for the bill to pass the Senate. So... if you live in Alabama and care about net neutrality, you should definitely vote.  \n\nEdit: To clarify though, Trump could still veto the resolution and it would also have to pass the House. But this is a way to force every senator to take a position on this issue before next year's midterm elections. And who knows what will happen if it builds enough momentum. Elected politicians are a lot more responsive to public opinion than FCC commissioners are.  \n\nThe CRA was actually passed by Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in the 1990s to make it easier to kill regulations. But it applies as much to an agency decision to repeal a regulation as it does to enact one. It sure would be deliciously ironic to use the CRA to save net neutrality.

Evidence of a crime doesn’t mean sufficient evidence to charge a crime.

It is painfully easy to de-anonymize data, especially location data.\n\nUltimately, data brokerage should be a service that exists at the individual level. You should be able to broker your own data and reap the financial reward of people who want access to that data to inform their decisions. The financial sums would be negligible, but it would also put the onus on you to determine when and if it's appropriate to publish your data.",

It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case \"[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)\" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)\n\n[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.\n\nCompanies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just \"behave\" when they have abused their power time and time again.\n\nFight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.\n",

They see a domain they don't like and use the scare tactic of threatening letters with lots of words like \"infringement\" and \"illegal\" thrown in to make you cave.  That doesn't mean you have broken the law, though.\n\nHowever, your case is unique because of the content of the page and what the domain is.  If your domain was comcastsucks.com, it would be perfectly legal because people know that it's going to be critical of Comcast before they actually get to the site.  But with comcastroturf.com, normal people don't know what's on the site *before* they visit.  Comcastroturf could easily be a website for a Community Astroturf company (and I know that's a stretch, but think of what less tech-savvy, older people would think).  \n\nThe other half is the content, in which you are critical of Comcast by name, but only in your conclusion.  This could leave the average viewer a bit confused at to why comcast is in the domain name, since there isn't anything critical as soon as the webpage opens.\n\nSo, in their eyes, you're not being *directly* critical of Comcast in the domain or content, which they see as infringing.  In my opinion, I think this could be fair use, but it'd be a close call, and that would depend heavily on the judge that you got.  The big issue is the disconnect between the domain name and the content.  You could change the content, but at this point, I can guarantee you that they already spidered your site and have screen shots of what your page looks like when it loads.\n\nEdit: As a follow up, lawyer up and have them send a letter claiming free speech, fair use, nonconfusing, etc.  They'll know what to do and how to do it.  Also, so long as you're not trying to profit from the site, either by selling it, raising funds through it, or promoting anything for which you get compensation (including advertising, or bartering for use of the domain), you'll be in a great position to fend this off.",

And you'll probably want to read this; it's even worse for Comcast and LG than you think.\n\nComcast contracts with LookingGlass to detect and remove threats to its brand and trademark online. Normally this is done for the right reasons, either sending takedown requests to obvious cyber-squatting domains similar to the actual trademark in an attempt to trick people, or phishing scams. But, this was clearly not the case here!\n\nHere's what happened: LG's automated crawler looks for recently-registered domain names with client trademarks in them. This crawler then sends an email to the client informing them of the domains and asking if they would like us to take action on them. Here's the key part: LG didn't just automatically submit a takedown request for this domain. Comcast was notified of this domain name, and asked that LG take it down. Uh-oh.\n\nMost likely, takedown was approved for this domain before any content was actually uploaded to the site. But that doesn't really make a difference; this is still fair use.

We were frequently asked to do takedown on charity sites that mentioned they had been sponsored by our clients (which they had been) just because they used Comcast's logo on the charity site. A logo placement that Comcast **paid to have on the charity's site**. Sometimes we were asked to do takedown on third-party affiliates that were corporate partners with our clients, effectively they asked us to shoot down their own site! The incompetence on parade here never failed to astound me.\n\nHowever! Comcast frequently used LG as its personal corporate bullying service, so it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if this was done with malicious intent instead of plain old dumbfuckery. I was asked to do takedown on Youtube videos because they ranked higher than Comcast's own videos in the search results, for example. So I wouldn't rule out mustache-twirling villainy. \n\nBut the best part? In the rare instances in which an analyst would dispute a takedown request by informing the management that the content in question fell under the umbrella of fair use, they would be told to proceed anyway. It didn't matter in the slightest how shitty Comcast's case for takedown was, the client's wishes always took precedent. I personally advocated tenaciously against several takedowns of content similar to this domain, using the logic that attempting to take down the domain name would lead to a massive blowback against Comcast and LG if the person who received the notice posted it online. I linked the wikipedia page for the Streisand Effect to management, even. Didn't matter in the end most of the time, but we got lucky and never had any serious fallout. Until now! \n\nThese notices don't do anything anyway, something I tried and failed to explain. They aren't legally binding, they aren't real cease and desist orders, they're basically nothing but a threat. But they don't even result in domains getting taken down because there's already a process for disputing a trademark in a domain name, it's called a UDRP dispute. This isn't a UDRP, and registrars and site owners know that, and they all tell LG (and rightly so) \"UDRP or GTFO\". But that requires a legal team to draft, and that's expensive, so let's just lie to our clients and pretend that these \"takedowns\" actually do something. \"Best-effort\", right? \n\nAnd the REALLY tragic thing? The analyst who submitted this is almost certainly getting thrown to the wolves, just for following orders. I watched it happen several times, an analyst would be crucified for doing exactly what management told them to do! Most of the analysts there wouldn't even be able to define fair use, much less catch something like this. You can't expect a SOC workforce that is almost exclusively part-timers making $18/hr (in the DC area, lel) to know these kinds of things, you have to have faith that the client knows the law and knows how things are likely to shake out. I hope it's clear now more than ever that any faith in Comcast to even approach doing the right thing is completely misplaced, which comes as a surprise to fucking nobody except for the management at LookingGlass.\n\nTo add insult to injury, LookingGlass is largely concerned with anti-phishing efforts, which is actually useful work that protects people from being defrauded and having their bank accounts emptied. That's one of the rare instances in which doing something to protect people and a company's brand are the same thing. But just to give you a dipstick as to the level of competence LookingGlass can bring to the table, LookingGlass, an anti-phishing company, was itself phished earlier this year. Someone sent a phishing email to LG asking for W-2s of every current and past employee, which were helpfully zipped up and sent off to the attacker. This resulted in several of my co-workers having their tax returns claimed by someone else before they filed, effectively stealing their tax return via identity theft as a result of this phishing scam. *LG only bothered to inform the employees that this was happening about two months after they were phished.* I received a letter in the mail after I had quit that informed me of what'd happened, and took the opportunity to up-sell me on purchasing coverage from Identity Guard Gold^tm as a helpful and easy payroll deduction! What a bargain! Thanks for giving away all of the information that someone would need to steal my identity LG, I'm really stoked to be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my fucking life! ",

If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.\nLast week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. \nWe had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds. \n\n(Emphasis theirs)\n\nI love that they're trying to hide behind regulations and insist that while they did take action to help hedge funds they didnt want to and that should count for something.

The danger of the mayority of the people supporting that is low.\nHowever there are more things that can be done without proper net neutrality. In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!\nIt sounds great but;\n1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!\n2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.\n3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.\n\nNet neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around. Collateral damage would include a ban on VPN services.\n \nSo yeah having a good Net Neutrality law is a must but stopping Net Neutrality law is much easier with free candy for consumers.

If we start referring to those who do not support net neutrality as people that are anti-Netflix, or anti-YouTube, and can make one of those the coloquial term, the general populace may start to care. \n\nIt needs to be taken a step further though, the American people need to realize that taking away net neutrality is in fact a method of limiting free speech. It could be called \"anti-Netflix\" legislation or \"pay-per-speak\" legislation. \n\nPeople need to be aware that this is not a matter of politics. Whether they identify as a democrat, republican, or any number of the minority parties, this is something that can be used to limit free speech.\n\nSteps to help:\n\n1. Learn the analogy of roads to explain net neutrality\n\n2. Explain the corporate motivation for ending net neutrality\n\n3. Refer to it as \"anti-Netflix\" or \"pay-per-speak\" legislation\n\n4. Explain that you believe Internet access is the same as any utility, and not a luxury service\n\nOrganization and awareness are the only way we can say net neutrality. If we can form a movement that defines net neutrality and promotes it, we may just be able to save it once more. ",

The internet is the freest possible form of expression. limiting someone's access to legal content, news, media, etc. is the definition of hindering free speech and expression   \n\n\n\nEdit: I have submitted a formal written request to the ACLU requesting representation for filing such a suit and have reached out to several lawyers in my area. I will be calling the ACLU legal help line tomorrow as well. They closed before I had a chance to call today. \n\n\nEdit-2: there have been several comments about the lack of legal standing for such a Lawsuit. Everyone is welcome to their opinion, but I disagree with these opinions. And there is point of fact enough standing in the argument the Texas V. Johnson sets the precedent for freedom expression is protected speech and that the use of the internet is a vehicle for the freest form of expression possible.

            "I've been thinking of developing a quick js script that web developers can use that will cause the website to go \"down\" on a pre-determined day. The script would basically just make the page look like it's loading really slowly and make the images super low resolution somehow and break other things; then after a few seconds a modal would pop saying \"This is what the internet would look like without net neutrality... Tell the FCC that you support net neutrality\".\n\nThe idea is that a ton of individual website owners would be able to just pop this script on their site to \"opt-in\" to a massive blackout of the web on a specific day. If they ever wanted to \"opt-out\" (say after we've won the internet back, or if they are concerned that it would go down on important days) they would just need to remove the call to this script.\n\nDoes anyone know if this already exists?

Their shareholders must start receiving negative returns that correlate directly to the end of net neutrality.  \n\nTo that end, boycotting them might have an impact, but that's just not possible these days.  The internet is as essential to modern life as the telephone was fifty years ago.  It's something that is a requirement for far too many essential services.\n\nThere is no other effective method left to us to impact their profits than physically harming their infrastructure.

            "Let me share my thoughts with you on how to win this fight this time around.\n\nThe entire game is about where the Republican party wants to be on all of this in the next 3 to 4 months. They were all opposed to Title II reclassification, but that does not mean they are all uniformly in favor of Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon ripping everyone off. However, they can't get over their ideological desire to reverse anything that has to do with President Obama.\n\nThat being said, all of this is going to come down to what I call \"brute force politics.\" Meaning, everything that was listed above (call your two Senators and Member of the House, donate, write your comment to the FCC) are ESSENTIAL first steps. \n\nThe next big step is to go even further and ask for a meeting at the local district office to explain why NN is important you. You should also get your friends who agree with you to come as well. You should also try to make it to one of their town halls (provided they are still holding them, some have cancelled because they are tired of being yelled at). Bodies and numbers and a real persistent and unbearable show of force on the ground as voters back home is how we are going to win this (brute force politics). \n\nNo one is immune to the political process, and if a sufficient number of Republicans feel the pressure back home, they will have to seek their escape hatch which will likely come in the form of asking the FCC not to proceed. If just ONE Republican Senator sent a letter to the FCC telling Chairman Pai, don't move forward, for whatever reason (think of a new plan, let us legislate instead, or I'm ok with Title II in the mean time etc), that will start the dominoes. \n\nThe Democrats are pretty much all in the right place on this after the broadband privacy repeal. They know the Republicans screwed themselves by doing the cable and telephone industry a blatant favor like that and have no incentive to let them off the hook. They'll run on Internet freedom coupled with being pro-privacy right over them in 2018. It is on the Republican majority to decide how they want to get out of the head lights on this one (but it is on all of us to make sure they understand that we are the headlights).\n\nThe MAIN challenge I am seeing is the purposeful attempt by Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon as well as Chairman Pai to make their plans out to be something completely different. For example, his proposal is called \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" when in fact it is destroying it. The big cable and telephone guys are advertising like mad that they support network  neutrality despite the fact that they sued the government several times to block network neutrality. \n\nI have no doubt they will try to bamboozle right leaning voters into thinking this is about Obama and government regulation as opposed to what it is really about, enhancing the power of Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon.\n\nSo everything in the post here is super good and useful as your initial fighting tools, but the extra steps are how we convert this into a third rail issue. \n\nYou want to know why this fight keeps coming up? It is because a lot of the politicians who have been terrible on these issues keep getting re-elected because people are willing to prioritize other social division issues or taxes etc before having this as a litmus test for voting. The moment the Republicans feel like this is a loser for them (conversely the Democrats feeling like this is a winner for them), the sooner we will get to final victory.\n\nBut make no mistake, we have the biggest fight ahead of us with Chairman Pai and this proposal. Now, we got 60 to 90 days to have maximum impact, so lets make it happen (especially if you are represented by a Republican Senator or Member of the House).",

What happens when you do?\n\nI'm Canadian, however many of my American friends who have had issue with their internet describe it as 'pulling teeth' trying to get it serviced or even looked at for that matter. If I have an issue and my ISP gives me grief, I have 3-4 alternative viable ISPs that I can switch to. Companies here practically bend over backwards trying to keep customers (then end up gouging them anyways).\n\nCanadian ISPs have their own problems - but for Americans; IMO the biggest issue is this 'gerrymandering' collusion bullshit that somehow came up where you only have one legitimate choice while a few streets down, they only have one choice of a completely different provider. So if you have a problem with your provider, it's a fight to get anything done because where else are you going to go? Smaller providers can't even start up because they get bought out immediately or the barrier to entry is so high that it's nearly impossible to get anywhere so you get this monopolistic bullshit.\n\nAnd somehow the companies have made Net Neutrality the big focus - it wouldn't even be needed if this collusion went away.

            "From the article: The US Federal Trade Commission is proposing a formal ban on subscriptions that are simple to start but difficult to stop. This morning, it announced a notice of proposed rulemaking it dubs “click to cancel,” requiring companies to make ending a subscription equivalently simple to signing up for one. That includes letting people use the same method for both actions — so a business can’t, for instance, let someone sign up for a service online but make them call a phone number to cancel.\n\nThe rule has a couple of other provisions. Many companies try to keep subscribers by offering special deals or perks, and they’re still allowed to do that, but they must offer an up-front opt-out that lets customers bypass the sales pitches. They also have to annually remind consumers that they’re enrolled in what are dubbed “negative option” programs, or programs where failing to cancel something is considered an agreement to keep paying, for anything but physical goods. Now, the agency has opened a public comment period for the proposal, after which it will potentially make revisions and pass the final regulation.\n\n“Companies should not be able to manipulate consumers into paying for subscriptions that they don’t want,” FTC chair Lina Khan told reporters in advance of the announcement. “We get countless complaints about this.”\n\nThat likely includes complaints for such popular services as Amazon Prime, which had to simplify its cancelation process last year in the EU under regulatory pressure. It’s also been a perennial irritation for people who start paying for The New York Times, gym memberships, cable service, and countless other subscription categories. Khan said it likely wouldn’t apply to non-commercial services like recurring political donations, which have also left some donors feeling scammed and tricked.",

            "Please correct me if I'm wrong, because I want to understand this, but I don't really understand the financial industry that well.\n\nBut this is what it seems like to me: some very rich guys decided to short gamestop stock. The fact that some super rich financial entities decided to do that, by itself, probably generally drives down the value of the stock because people start thinking \"oh shit, giant fund X thinks this stock is gonna tank, it's probably gonna tank!\" then people sell their shares to get away from that stock and because the stock market is at least partly mass psychology/mass delusion it becomes self-fulfilling prophecy. The giant fund casts doubt on the stock and short sells it, the doubt makes the stock actually go down, the giant fund wins their shorts.\n\nBut this time a bunch of redditors with some money said \"okay, no, I think gamestop is a fine stock, I'll take the other end of that bet\", and the fact that they all bought gamestop propped up the stock price, causing the giant rich funds to lose their short bets.\n\nBecause of the audacity of a bunch of regular retail investors daring to take on and beat a giant elite hedge fund, they're treated like some sort of financial terrorists. They represent a threat to the financial industry, which often works by having super rich funds manipulate the market to get richer. Having a bunch of regular people interfere with the work of the elite financial class poses a threat to the games they play, and so they've got the entire financial industry, and their lapdogs in the media, and potentially their (captured) regulatory agencies to crack down on this new threat.",

            ">The inexplicable rise in AMC and GameStop shares  \n  \nIt's explained, very easily, and without much digging.  Both stocks were targeted by hedge fund short sellers so greedy they left themselves vulnerable to a short squeeze. Smart intellectuals at /r/wallstreetbets (the smarter-est) saw this vulnerability and memed and hyped redditors into buying and holding GME and AMC so hard that that the shorts will be squeeze to bankruptcy.  \n  \nThen, this week, the shorts doubled down on it!  They took loans from another hedge fund to cover the shorts!  That was when gamestop was near 100.  Now gamestop is at 350 (meaning the shorts just lost another 200% of the money so far), and a new massive squeeze just over the horizon.  On Friday, all the options become due.  And given the current price of the stock, millions the options are \"in the money\" where normally they would be worthless. Which triggers forced buying of shares to from everyone who was shorting the stock through options.  How much?  I think something like 20% of the total available gamestop shares are required to cover it.  And the buying by WSB (wallstreetbets) ate up almost all the available shares to buy.  Which means they *might* have to buy stock at 3x, 4x, 10x? times the current price.   \n  \nI'm expecting fireworks and this to be the short squeeze super nova of the century.

Your choices are taken away.\n\nPeople have been complaining about this slowdown problem for years right here on Reddit and posted many times that they are upgrading because their phone is slow.\n\nIf your ISP started slowing down your internet to make your router last longer or Ford removed 40 percent of the horsepower in your truck during servicing to extend the engine life you'd freak out.\n\nIt's something you bought. Apple does not get to start disabling features on it without involving you in the decision or at lest disclosing the practice so you can make an informed choice to upgrade, replace the battery or change to an Android.\n\nBefore even getting into motives the entire problem is a stealth downgrade of one part of your phone because another part is not performing well that can be fixed easily.\n\nIt is deceptive at best and malicious at worst. The lawsuit will force Apple to disclose internal emails which will show their full intents. If even one marketing person made a joke about how this is going to increase sales of new units then Apple is going to lose this. Even if they were honestly trying to be helpful it doesn't matter because they caused real harm by disabling people's performance without telling them.\n\nThey will lose this one or settle. \n\nCry as much as you want but if you changed this to a different company the same practice wouldn't be tolerated. \n\nFurthermore marketing departments for decades have been pushing to take choice away from consumers as it's on the interest of the company.\n\nI want to run an old iOS that works fine on my old phone. This shouldn't be a war of cunning with Apple to find ways to stop them downloading a gigabyte of OS on all my devices then harassing me to use it.\n\nThese are mine.\n\nI paid for them.\n\nI shouldn't be locked in a perpetual struggle with the manufacturer over how I want to use them.

Two iPhone 4S, to be exact. \n\nBoth of them have brand new batteries, that I Installed myself.\n\nThe first iPhone 4S, is running **iOS 7.1.2**\n\nThe second iPhone 4S, is running **iOS 9.3**\n\nThe iPhone running iOS 7.1.2, is able to open anything very quickly, like the camera for instance. \n\nThe iPhone running iOS 9.3, takes several seconds to simply open the camera.\n\nIn fact, I have ANOTHER iPhone in front of me, an iPhone 5, which is running iOS 10.2.1.\n\nThis phone is considerably faster than its previous generation counterpart, yet, struggles to achieve the same thing that the iPhone 4S does on iOS 7.1.2.\n\n**EDIT :** My point is that Apple should let user choose what version they want to use. We used to be able to downgrade, but no longer can. I do understand that each updates brings new security updates, but when Apple literally harass you into updating your phone, it gets annoying really fast. \n\nBy harassing, I mean that multiple times per day, it will automatically download the multiple gigabytes of update software by itself and therefore use much of my battery to constantly download those updates. I need my storage, I don't want that 1.6GB clogging my limited storage and then constantly have notifications to \"Click here to start the update\", then having to type in my code to \"Remind me later\", which is just going to ask me in a couple hours. \n\nTHIS is what my point is all about.",

I’ve been reading about it the last couple of days and if someone could shed some light on what I’m maybe missing, that’d be greatly appreciated, because I am legit confused. \n\nI had Samsung phones. As it got older, the battery got worse, my phone got worse. I replaced the battery and it got immediately better. \n\nMy laptop battery was doing the same. After 8 years it gave out on me, I bought a new one from my manufacturer, and when I put the new one in, my computer was clearly running much quicker (although I have a laptop now with Battery Calibration which I think helps (maybe? Idk)). \n\nHow come when the same thing happens to iPhones, it’s this big “new” problem? MSI and HP have both told me in support tickets that new batteries will speed things up because the computer isn’t having to slow itself down to protect itself. \n\nTL;DR: Have other companies being sued already or made customers aware already of this issue? Or is it just Apple and no one else has actually noticed that this happens to all devices because it’s kinda how batteries work? Or am I just unlucky with my ~8 electronics I’ve replaced batteries in over the years? ",

            "I totally understand why they did this. My last phone, a Nexus 6p didn't slow down the CPU when the phone got older. I kept happily, updating to the very newest version of Andriod.\n\nWhat would happen is, I would be looking at a website or using some app, my phone would be at 30%, and BAM it would suddenly die. Infuriating.\n\nLike the iPhone, I couldn't easily replace the battery. That's what really makes me mad. After 1-2 years, you either end up with a phone that only stays charged a couple of hours. Or it's slow as shit because it can't properly power the hardware.\n\nThere's an easy solution, make it easy to replace the battery!",
            "I think this fits perfectly into Apples M.O--and I don't mean in a conspiratorial sort of way. The way I see it, Apple's operating environments have long hinged on simplicity and a boxed in experience. Maintenance, Customization, and/or user privileges have for a long time been fairly limited and opaque. \n\nWhy then, would anyone expect any other sort of solution than a software one? This has so many upsides for Apple (and to a lesser degree it's users). A software fix like this probably cost a few thousand to make if that. Some simple testing and boom, it's done. Users can keep using their older phones (albeit more slowly), and their aging batteries can live a little longer. All for the low low price of $0. \n\nSetting up the infrastructure and stock of (quality) batteries necessary to handle this would cost them a vast amount of money and not to mention that there simply aren't enough Apple stores and capable technicians to get these things done in a timely manner. It's never been Apple's intention to cheaply maintain stuff. \n\nAs someone who works in the repair industry, I would love to see this change. I would love to have easy access to schematics for board level diagnostics, I would love to have a regulated parts supply instead of a gray market of questionable and inconsistent quality. I would love to be able to buy OEM parts at a reasonable price and offer that service to you. At the moment, none of this is readily available/possible.\n\nIf you as a consumer want it to change, get involved/learn/call your reps about [the right to repair](http://repair.org/stand-up/) movement. Take that frustration and channel it into something useful. Apple (and virtually all electronic manufacturers) will never hear you if you only hang out on Reddit and jerk each other off on how sneaky they are or how they \"force\" you to upgrade. Suing them is missing the mark in my opinion. ",
            "What Apple is doing is smart. Being transparent is where this is an issue. Batteries degrade, this is life and reality. If they didn't do this and phones started shutting off this would be a MUCH bigger issue. This is also where Apple failed with the non replaceable batteries, well I should say user replaceable. If they don't want people opening the phones they could design them in a way that would still block access to other components when sliding a back cover that would void warranty if exposed. Correct me if I am wrong though with the new laws saying you can service your own device without breaking warranty it now becomes kinda pointless to continue this locked down hardware approach. ",

            "People who are cruel to animals are cruel to humans without second thought. It’s well documented.\n\nEdit:\n\nYou wouldn't think saying ‘cruelty = bad’ would be such a triggering statement to people, and most of these replies don’t warrant any attention or response, but I’ll clarify. \n\nI know people in the research community who have to perform humane kills while completing their work. They describe the conflict of emotions they feel knowing that they are doing important work while also knowing they are doing everything they can to be humane. They describe the reverence of knowing they are the last thing this living creature will see. This is because it takes a human toll. Even killing things like mice or small birds has a mental effect. These people are not abusive psychos, they have real human feelings and responses that inform their actions and work. In a more severe scenario, I went to a large state undergrad with a chimp lab that had some student employees, one of them being my upstairs neighbor. He ended up having a mental breakdown and we found out after the police came looking for him when he disappeared for a month and was found living in the woods in a distressed state. Any of these people understand the necessity of the work they are doing but they understand the toll, and so they don’t do things without reason or purpose or without humane thought typically because of this. \n\nKilling more than is necessary bc you have a deadline to hit is the definition of maniacal cruelty, and we already see evidence of the real world impact of this. Mass layoffs, sanctioned cruelty and attacks, and this is the guy people want to entrust their lives to on a trip to Mars? You really think this guy wouldn't cut off life support to half the pods to ensure some type of mission metric only clear to him without a second thought? \n\nLol at the red herrings. I’ve been defending against animal cruelty for 20+ years, your ‘hitler was a vegan’ anecdote is cute but stupid, and entirely unoriginal. \n\nTo those who don’t understand how you can consume meat and not be cruel or strive for humane practices, I recommend the documentary ‘eating animals.’\n\nAnd to those of you defending the cruelty, well, we already know that at least half the people in this country are scary crazy, so no surprises there.",

            "I do medical animal research with mice and there are so many red flags here. Most organizations using public funding and doing any animal research use IACUC measures which dictate one should use the animal model of least complexity (rodent versus primate versus fish versus fruit fly) and the least amount of animals necessary to be statistically significant, while also minimizing pain. This is entirely unethical by IACUC standards, but unfortunately rules are much looser for private company where IACUC doesn't apply, although I am curious of Musks funding sources. In the research center I work at, something like this would never have been approved. No one would actually fund this had it been written in a grant. People have done similar research in rats and there are still kinks to be worked out... to do primate research for this is insane.

            "From the article: Blink-182 fans are furious at Ticketmaster, the band, and society in general over the astronomical ticket prices to the band’s reunion tour—Billboard has cited ticket prices as high as $600 in some cities. This is, unfortunately, the logical outcome of the entertainment monopoly Ticketmaster has built since it merged with Live Nation, creating a live events behemoth in which a huge portion of ticketing, venues, and the artists themselves are owned or controlled by a single company. \n\nIt is arguably also the case that, in trying to “fight” ticket brokers (called “scalpers” by many), Ticketmaster has done something that is very lucrative for itself and for artists, but also worse for the average fan: It has simply jacked up ticket prices for certain high-profile events to a level where all tickets are more-or-less priced at the maximum level that the secondary market would normally bear. More on this in a minute.\n\nTo understand how we got here, it’s useful to go back to 2009, when Bruce Springsteen wrote an open letter apologizing to his fans for the experience they had trying to buy his tickets on Ticketmaster. At the time, his tickets had gone on sale, sold out almost instantly, and Ticketmaster began automatically redirecting fans to a ticket resale site called TicketsNow, which Ticketmaster also owned. Fans were confused, thinking they were still buying “face value” tickets from Ticketmaster, only now the prices for the best tickets—with a face value that maxed out at $98 in New Jersey, for example—were selling for hundreds of dollars.",
            "I told my friends, it's literally hundreds of dollars cheaper to get a passport and go see them in South America.\n\nAnd all of this includes the price of a flight, a decent hotel, renting a car, food and getting the best section available at that venue.\n\nLiterally all of this costs hundreds of $$$ less than trying to get a decent seat anywhere in the US",

Any act can do this if they really want, but they make more money working through Ticketmaster…any one of these acts that says they can’t control this is full of shit and just siphoning as much money as they can from their fans.",

Neat, I'm all for saying fuck resellers. The problem is THE FUCKING TICKETS STILL COST FOUR GRAND FOR REGULAR PEOPLE TOO. Didn't really think that through beyond pure, unadulterated greed.\n\nEdit: Lol @ the replies saying \"This is just the way it is and it's the only way it can be.\"",

            "Interesting moment to remember that one of the reasons Blink-182 blew up was because the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed the cap on how many stations a radio company could own, which essentially ended independent radio stations and opened the door for ClearChannel to buy up radio stations all over, basically monopolizing the industry. ClearChannel then started pushing the same songs, artists and playlists on the whole country, including Blink 182. \n\nBlink 182s success is, in large part, thanks to monopoly power.",

            "I mean... I'm gonna be the asshole and say that while monopolies are bad, ticket prices being so high is ultimately the natural outcome, and something that you shouldn't be trying to fight, even if it sucks that you can't get a cheap ticket by \"camping at the ticket booth\" and hoping you can grab one before scalpers buy them out.\n\nLike, prices are that high because people are willing to pay them. It's better for those prices to be captured for the band than line the pockets of scalpers. Sure if you could artificially sell tickets below the price people are willing to pay and somehow exclude scalpers, sure, and that would help provide some access to people, but ultimately the same number of people get to see the show, and the band/venue/etc. makes far less money for it.\n\nLike, it sucks for most of us, but yeah, that's what happens when there's lots of demand for something with a limited supply: high prices.\n\nAs pointed out, the effective solution here if an act wants to keep prices down is to increase the supply of tickets, which is better for fans anyway, since it provides more opportunities for their schedules to line up and give them the opportunity to go see a band they love.",

Setting a subreddit to private, aka “going dark,” will mean that the communities taking part will be inaccessible by the wider public while the planned 48-hour protest is taking place.\n\nAs a Reddit post about the protest, that’s since been cross-posted to several participating subreddits, explains:\n\nOn June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren’t able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn’t something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nA complete list of the hundreds of communities taking part (known in Reddit parlance as “subreddits”) includes dozens with over a million subscribers each.",

        "post_body": "Hey reddit, I wanted to give a quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** that lots of us are planning for July 12th.\n\nThere's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. \n\nReddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!\n\nNet neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.\n\nThis day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.\n\nThe current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. \n\nSo! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a \"site blocked\" message to show they could be censored, or an \"upgrade your Internet service to access this site\" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",

I asked him, specifically, what he was going to propose, and I've received no answer. Big surprise. My two (D) senators, however, are clearly on board for NN. \n\nI've shifted to talking with my state senator, asking him to create laws for NYS in the event that the Feds fuck this all up. The community manager I've been talking with has been pretty positive in my conversations. I guess the legislation is wrapping up in the next few weeks, but after that he's going to take all my information I've sent him and have a chat with the Senator to see what his thoughts are. I pointed him to your website and referenced the event for 12 July as part of the overwhelming support for NN.

Customers represent a wide array of genders, races, ethnicities, abilities, ages, religions, sexual orientations, military status, backgrounds, and political views. It’s critical that Amazon employees are also diverse and that we foster a culture where inclusion is the norm. Amazon prioritizes equal pay, and since we’ve been measuring and publishing the ratio over the past several years, women have earned between 99.8 and 100.0 cents for every dollar that men have earned in the same jobs. We also believe it’s critical that we increase opportunity for underrepresented groups to enter the technology workforce. We created Amazon Future Engineer, a childhood-to-career computer science education program designed to inspire and educate millions of students globally from underserved communities to pursue careers in computer science. It’s not only that diversity, equity, and inclusion are good for business—it’s more fundamental than that. It’s simply right.\n\n> The inequitable treatment of Black people is unacceptable. We stand in solidarity with our Black employees, customers, and partners, and we are committed to helping build a country and a world where everyone can live with dignity and free from fear. We support legislation to combat misconduct and racial bias in policing, efforts to protect and expand voting rights, and initiatives that provide better health and educational outcomes for Black people.\n\n> The rights of LGBTQ+ people must be protected. We were early and strong supporters of marriage equality and will continue to advocate for protections and equal rights for transgender people. We stand together with the LGBTQ community and are working at the U.S. federal and state level on legislation, including supporting passage of the Equality Act. Amazon provides gender transition benefits based on the Standards of Care published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).\n\nAnd here’s the current policy: https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/our-positions\n\n> We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company that helps us build the best range of products and services for our broad customer base. Amazon customers represent a wide array of geographies, cultures, genders, races, ethnicities, abilities, ages, religions, sexual orientations, military status, backgrounds, and political views. To build the best products and services for our diverse customers, it’s important for our workforce to be diverse, and this drives our commitment to equitable and inclusive employment and business opportunities — from prioritizing equal pay, to creating career pathways, to partnering with small and diverse businesses that help us serve our customers. We also believe that inequitable treatment of anyone—including Black people, LGBTQ+ people, Asians, women, and others—is unacceptable, and we advocate for policies designed to remove barriers to equity and create an inclusive environment for all employees.\n\nI’m weary of how easily duped ya’ll are.",

            "From the article: Since coming into power, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has barraged USAID, the international aid agency that dispenses food and supplies to nations all over the world. It is likely that the agency will soon be shuttered and could be subsumed into the U.S. State Department. Now, new reporting shows USAID was actually investigating one of Musk’s companies at the time that he attacked the agency.\n\nThe Lever [reported](https://www.levernews.com/from-watergate-to-elon-gate/) Tuesday that USAID’s inspector general was in the process of investigating its own public-private partnership between Musk’s Starlink and the Ukrainian government at the time that the billionaire’s DOGE crippled the agency. Publicly available information about that probe is still online. An announcement from last May reads: “The USAID Office of Inspector General, Inspections and Evaluations Division, is initiating an inspection of USAID’s oversight of Starlink satellite terminals provided to the Government of Ukraine. Our objectives are to determine how (1) the Government of Ukraine used the USAID-provided Starlink terminals, and (2) USAID monitored the Government of Ukraine’s use of USAID-provided Starlink terminals.”\n\nMusk has called the agency “evil” and a “criminal organization,” though the fact that USAID was investigating his company may suggest ulterior motivations for the billionaire’s vitriol. It’s unclear what the Starlink probe’s status is right now.",

Like his \"threat\" of applying tariffs to Russia if they don't stop the war.... or the 'threat' of 10% tariffs on China, are both way softer/more friendly than the default 25% tariffs he's talking about for mexico/canada.  America is quite literally treating its allies worse than its treating Russia / China, their main geopolitical opponents.  It's absurd, but it's where we're at.\n\nI'd argue America as a country, and any services that come from America, is, from the perspective of other countries now, similar to doing business with Russa.  Eg. We don't use Kaspersky, because even if its base software is decent, they're clearly controlled by a hostile nation state from the perspective of most western democracies.  By electing a xenophobic dictator, Americans have chosen to become a hostile nation state to all other countries in the world -- they're even openly mulling invading peaceful countries like Greenland ffs.

Bluesky was already becoming a solid alternative before this stuff but now it had to be marred by Reddit forcing people into it.\n\nDisgustingly manipulative behavior. Especially when there were already ways to view Twitter content without needing to visit it (xcancel.com). Even screenshots are banned on many subreddits which is just fucking wild to me. This is just a political stunt to force people's hand into doing what you want them to do.\n\nAnd the excuse that Twitter has a bunch of misinfo when even non-politically related subreddits whose Twitter links had content self-contained to the topic relevant to the subreddit is such a vapid excuse. If I'm browsing a subreddit such as r/wow and I see a Twitter link, it's going to be about fucking WoW content. Not political misinformation bullcrap. It's like Youtube or any social media website; a self-contained bubble with content you actually wish to see. \n\nIt's just so exhausting to see a bunch of moral crusaders act like they aren't committing massive double standards with the way they're behaving here.\n\nAlso let's continue supporting Chinese governed media/games who totally aren't censoring shit themselves on the shit they release out in the west. Try saying 'fuck china' in Marvel Rivals and the message won't even be sent. Say 'fuck america' and it will. Say anything relating to Taiwan being a country and it won't get sent. Where the fuck are you guys with this kind of bullshit as well?\n\nEdit: Furthermore the fact that every one of these announcements posts get instantly locked is fucking pathetic. Reddit truly showing its penchant for being an echo chamber now. Acting like everyone agrees with this by purposely locking these threads down so you get to say \"see! people agree with us 😊\". Immature and childish behavior. \n\nIf there's one thing this website fucking loves it's generalizing and abusing kafkatrap methods, forcing people's hands through echo chambers, and then act all surprised why people become divided all while acting disingenuous and feigning ignorance.\n\nFuck Elon and screw all of you for acting disingenuous and labeling people who dare to disagree with banning anything related with this website all while making up obviously false excuses. Arrogant folk who think they're all always 100% correct in every matter. Absolutely insufferable."

It removes revenue from companies like Comcast. No cable box rental fees, no monthly payments for channels, a shrinking TV audience kills ad revenue (Comcast owns NBC/Universal so it hurts them big time), etc...\n\nThere are over 22 million Comcast subscribers, about 50% of Comcast's profit comes from cable TV and TV ads, and an average cable bill is $103 per month... a sudden and massive TV subscriber drop could do some SERIOUS damage to their bottom line, kill investor confidence, and even cause the company to implode.\n\nGet an antenna. Use alternative entertainment. Spread the word and kick them in the money bags.\n\nI've already done that myself. Many of you have as well. That isn't enough.

Impeachment will not be enough because Mike Pence shows no inclination to support Net Neutrality either. So there are a few ways to do this:\n\nThe REALLY hard way:  \n1) Throw both the House and the Senate to Democratic Control.  \n2) Elect a new House Speaker who is a Democrat.  \n3) Remove both the President and the Vice President from office.  \nThat would result in the Democratic Speaker of the House becoming President and it would be absolutely unprecedented to remove both the President and Vice President at the same time.

            "I posted this in a different thread, but it bears repeating:\n\nThe FCC has incorrectly(likely purposefully) asserted their authority to enforce their regulations on states, as opposed to allowing states to make their own net neutrality rules.\n\nThey directly reference 47 U.S. Code § 1302 Section 706 a and b.\nHere is that code:\n>The Commission and each State commission with regulatory jurisdiction over telecommunications services shall encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans (including, in particular, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms) by utilizing, in a manner consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, price cap regulation, regulatory forbearance, measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market, or other regulating methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.\n\n>(b)Inquiry\n\n>The Commission shall, within 30 months after February 8, 1996, and annually thereafter, initiate a notice of inquiry concerning the availability of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans (including, in particular, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms) and shall complete the inquiry within 180 days after its initiation. In the inquiry, the Commission shall determine whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. If the Commission’s determination is negative, it shall take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.\n\nThey then assert multiple times that this code \"Provides affirmative legal authority for our open internet rules\"\n\nThey cement their assertion later on in the record with \n\"Section 2 of the Communications Act grants the Commission jurisdiction over 'all interstate and foreign \r\ncommunication by wire or radio.'”\n\nThat is law that was written in 1934, literally before TV, being used in an attempt to imply regulative authority over the internet.\n\nThe dissenters on the record point out that the FCC assumed the text of 47 U.S. Code § 1302 Section 706 A & B to be a delegatory(meaning it delegates actual, real power to the FCC, and thereby, actual authority over what states can and cant do) declaration, rather than being simply hortatory(which essentially means restricted to the Bully Pulpit, I.E. they can only apply verbal or written pressure on states to follow their regulations)\n\nI agree 1000% with the dissenting parties. \n\nAs they further point out, section 706 of the code used by the FCC NEVER once expressly, by any means, gives authority to the FCC. There is what sounds like a call to action, with lines like \"shall encourage\", but nowhere is the FCC actually given the explicit authority to make rules about telecommunications that supersede the rules about telecommunications within an individual state.\n\nThe array of assumptions based off of incorrect interpretations of US Codes, and clauses based off those assumptions, is the way they assume their authority over state communication commissions.\n\nThose incorrect assumptions all come to head in this: \n\"The Commission thus has evaluated possible state regulations of broadband Internet access service to guard against any conflict with federal \r\nlaw.\"\n\nAnd\n\n\"We also make clear that the states are bound by our forbearance decisions today\"\n\nAnd lastly\n\n\"Finally, we announce our firm intention to exercise our preemption authority to preclude \r\nstates from imposing obligations on broadband service that are inconsistent with the carefully tailored \r\nregulatory scheme we adopt in this Order\"\n\nThey base the largest part of their assumptions off of 47 US Code § 1302 Section 706 Subsection A. For this reason, it is in my not-quite-yet-expert-but-very-well-versed opinion that the republicans in the FCC are not capable of reading. For clearly, this:\n\n>The Commission and each State commission with regulatory jurisdiction over telecommunications services\n\nnot only **doesn't** explicitly give authority over state telecom regulatory bodies. It, in fact, gives them the SAME authority. This excerpt, along with the remainder of Section 706 Subsection A, in absolutely no way, implies any sort of FCC authority over telecommunications.\n\nYet the commission uses it explicitly to assert the exact kind of authority it doesn't describe. And that's the world we live in.\n\nI hope this helped.",

            "Huh.\n\nSo you guys ever hear somebody say they were against powerful bureaucracies made up of unelected officials who could, on a whim, wield the force of law? And that probably seemed nuts to you -- why wouldn't it?\n\nWell, this is why.\n\nThe FCC is an independent agency of the federal government, created via an act of Congress. These agencies are created with various justifications, but the bottom line is that Congress (who, Constitutionally speaking, holds regulatory power at the federal level of government) does not have the personnel to manage the regulation of all industries. That's a fair observation, I think, and a non-partisan one.\n\nWe here on Reddit often complain (or at least, this is my perception) that corporations buy and sell politicians like stockbrokers buy stocks. And hey, as a lifetime member of the right wing in America, I don't think you're wrong about that. I agree, and I think that it's a terrible thing.\n\nOur representatives actually represent corporations -- and yes, part of that is due to the gutting of campaign finance reform. But with enough money and determination, you can launder money through enough shell corporations and fake union organizations and PACs that, in the end, campaign finance laws really won't make that huge a difference. If you like, we can try it, but please consider a different approach as well -- and not even as a replacement for campaign finance reform, but possibly as a second prong in your counter-attack.\n\nRepeal the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act. Massively expand Congress, so the bar for getting in is lower -- so YOU can run for Congress, without having to beg Verizon for money and airtime for campaign ads. Plus, this increases the relative power of your vote FOR a congressional representative -- which then increases the dollar amount it takes to win each individual vote.\n\nWhich makes it stupidly expensive to buy politicians. If you can't beat em, bleed them. Soak up their money with tons of members of the House. BE one of those members, and fight them from a position of some power.\n\nAnd not only this, but it will take a zombie horde of lobbyists to keep track of all of those Reps. Those are expensive, too. The more complicated we make this, the better -- complicated is expensive. And expensive is a feature, not a bug.\n\nAnd then implement campaign finance reform. A reformed, expanded House as the anvil, and campaign finance reform as the hammer -- we could structure the federal government to effectively resist corporate influence, from its very core.\n\nI'm not very hopeful that this will ever be done, to be honest. Hell, I'm not that hopeful that many people will listen, even here, in this shitstorm. But I'm gonna keep trying anyway. ",

Parler’s recent deplatforming for failing to seriously police death threats and illegal content before and after the fatal Capitol riots.  \n\nExcept that this isn't exactly accurate.  Parler's \"free speech\" laissez-faire attitude is a lie.  A friend of mine shared a screenshot of Parler's internal moderation UI, taken from that massive hack a few days ago.  Other than the weird bit where they consider nudity and porn to be worse than child exploitation or terrorism, the interesting thing to note is that *all new users* start off shadowbanned until they have a certain number of posts approved by their moderators.

            "The Pirate bay guys are an interesting combination of brilliant and mind bending stupidity. Given what they did for a living, one would expect Gottfrid to encrypt his friggen hard drive, for one. But their site was pretty much kicked off every single major hosting site in the world, and they figured out how to keep things ticking with very little downtime on a shoestring budget.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that the Parler folks didn't spend too many minutes thinking about what they would do when they (predictably) got booted of their first cloud provider. From what it sounds like, they used many pieces of provider-specific tech, meaning they will need to rewrite big chunks of their back-end stack before they can reopen. Accepting some lock-in to gain a bit of velocity is usually a good trade off if you're making e.g. an e-commerce site. But given what *they* do for a living, that sounds like a poor choice.",

Thats lazy programming. You write in an abstraction layer that can be easily modified to fit different platform providers. \n\nBut, knowing that the Parler hack executors exploited a bug in what was probably an unfinished/poorly tested account creation system - that gave the exploiters admin privlidges - this doesn't surprise me. \n\nJesusfuck.

            "I had GPT fact check the stats and it said:\n\n“1. Tariffs vs. Trade Barriers vs. Currency Manipulation\n\nThese are distinct concepts often conflated for political impact:\n\na. Tariffs\n\t•\tThese are actual import taxes—easy to measure.\n\t•\tFor example, China’s average applied tariff rate is around 7.5–10%, not 67%.\n\t•\tVietnam’s average is around 10–15%, depending on the sector.\n\t•\tThe WTO tracks these in public databases.\n\nb. Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs)\n\t•\tIncludes things like:\n\t•\tLengthy customs clearance\n\t•\tLocal content requirements\n\t•\tSubsidies to domestic industries\n\t•\tLicensing restrictions\n\t•\tHard to quantify precisely and often subject to interpretation.\n\t•\tSome industries (like agriculture or tech) are more heavily protected than others.\n\nc. Currency Manipulation\n\t•\tRefers to a country artificially devaluing its currency to make exports cheaper and imports more expensive.\n\t•\tIt’s extremely difficult to assign a percentage value to this—there’s no agreed-upon formula to say, “Vietnam manipulates its currency by 30%, so add that to its tariff rate.”\n\n⸻\n\n2. Problems with the Numbers in the Chart\n\t•\tThese percentages appear to be arbitrary aggregations that lack citation or international acceptance.\n\t•\tThe chart inflates the impact by blending real tariffs with subjective NTBs and currency practices.\n\t•\tThe WTO, IMF, and World Bank do not publish such figures in this form.\n\nFor instance:\n\t•\tCambodia: 97% tariff? Cambodia has preferential trade access under GSP with the U.S. and EU and very low actual tariffs.\n\t•\tVietnam: 90%? This is wildly overstated. USTR reports point to non-tariff barriers, but nothing near this.\n\t•\tMadagascar: 93%? That’s not supported by any public data.\n\t•\tU.K., Australia, Brazil: 10%? All three countries have free trade or low-tariff relationships with the U.S.\n\n⸻\n\n3. What’s Likely Going On\n\nThis appears to be part of a political narrative intended to:\n\t•\tJustify high retaliatory tariffs by making foreign trade policies look outrageously unfair.\n\t•\tManufacture consent for trade wars and economic nationalism by inflating foreign protectionism.\n\t•\tCollapse complex economic dynamics into an easy-to-digest “they’re cheating, we’re fair” chart.\n\nThere’s a strategic rhetorical move happening here—what Noam Chomsky might call “manufactured outrage” to mobilize domestic support.\n\n⸻\n\n4. What You Can Trust\n\t•\tWTO’s World Tariff Profiles: Offers real average applied MFN tariffs.\n\t•\tUSTR’s National Trade Estimate Report: Identifies specific non-tariff barriers by country.\n\t•\tIMF & Treasury Reports: Monitor currency practices, including manipulation claims.”",

Same owner when faced with angry workers who had been on overtime and weekend hours for over a month straight actually said to the entire floor that he gets it, everyone is suffering, he has only been out on the boat twice this summer.\n\nAnyway they have burned through so many people in the town at this point that would consider working there, and tons of people only hear about the nightmare of working there by word of mouth.

She tells you that every day she carpools with another employee and he was late which is why she was late. She has never been late before and she tells you that the person she car pools with wasn't written up. What should you do?\" I asked what the policy was and they said the policy was to write up my direct report and the other manager for not writing up their employee. \n\nThey literally started the interview by saying \"you probably have seen that Forbes article about how hard it is to work at Amazon. It's 100% true it's completely normal to find people crying especially during busy season. This job is soul crushing but if you can say you worked at Amazon for 3 years you can literally go anywhere\".\n\nThe best was when they sent me an offer. You were at will employment and at any time they could change your shift and your distribution center. Meaning they could decide that next week you were moving to night shift halfway across the country and you just had to accept. They offered a 15k signing bonus with the caveat that if you left or were fired before your 1st year the bonus was actually a high interest loan that would be prorated to your first day (so if you were fired on month 11 you'd have to pay 11 months of interest and your entire signing bonus).

For example we are trained to clean as you go, even in the bins that store product. Basically just make everything nice, neat and presentable so that when an item needs to be picked for a customer the picker can find it easily. The stow rate was much higher than the pick rate and we brought in more than we shipped out every day. That means the building was full constantly and management kept telling us to stuff the building further and faster, which created many safety problems that got ignored. For people like me that had been there for years it was easy to hit our rates and clean up at the same time but with so few of us it was pointless. Basically at the end of the day the building was just unsafe and the rates too high for most people to ever achieve.

            "Hey everyone - former agency/software platform marketer in the the recruitment space. I used to work for a company called Symphony Talent. We have a platform that’s basically an all in one jobs board, marketing platform and automated service for HR departments and recruiters to basically do what they do quicker - process applications, fill roles, etc etc.\n\nAmazon was one of our clients. My client. I worked for around 3-4 months on marketing the ‘grads opportunities’ for the warehouse roles. I did their paid social - ie LinkedIn ads, Facebook ads etc. Nothing too complex. But I still feel shame and guilt at even working on this account. For all my values, I ended sucking it up for a couple months for a paltry wage. But I keep my eyes and ears open.\n\nBut the name of game - whether it was Amazon, Sky or CDK - was headcount. Get people through the meat grinder. \n\nHR departments reduce everything to numbers. You’re just a means to results. To productivity. \n\nThe trend in the HR space now is automation - as little human interaction with the humans coming into your company until you’re pretty much ready to hire. That way you’re not pulling off managers from their day job of sitting around doing f all. \n\nWhenever I asked about - oh what do you want to do about all the negative press (to both my bosses and clients) - the response was always, look there are problems, but we’re giving people work. \n\nAnd that’s the thing - you can brush off any criticism with, ‘oh we make it so you’re not completely starving in the gutter’. \n\nWe had another client with data centres in Czech Republic. Apparently Prague is the data service centre of half the world, and devs in the city just float around between companies every few years. Their literal approach is to just brute force as many bums on seats through paid media / display campaigns delivered thru programmatic ads. It’s the same approach in India. They don’t care about you as a person - basically they just want their cogs, and will have you till you’re burned out.\n\nAnd this practice is normalised. Like, the suffering is just collectively internalised for an entire generation of workers - people begin to think that everyone should be treated like slabs of meat. \n\nAmazon’s just following the HR trends that other companies like Nike etc have been doing in their free trade zones in the global south for decades.",

You'll recall that as people got wise to how ISPs were trying to throttle or otherwise hamstring competitors, ISPs got more creative -- and began intentionally letting interconnection points with transit operators and companies like Netflix get congested. Why? ISPs like Comcast and Verizon hoped to 1) kill the common practice of settlement-free peering, and 2) force companies like Netflix to pay an additional toll if they wanted video packets to reach subscribers on time, and intact (aka \"double dipping\" or more bluntly, extortion).\n\n> Unnoticed by many in the lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against Charter over slow speeds was the fact that Charter executives were busted candidly discussing this strategy to drive up costs for competitors and transit operators.

            "I'm not a fan of these kind of blanket statements, and I think reddit is particularly bad for them.\n\nI think in any job that you can deliver work remotely (tech, admin, lots of creative roles) you should always have the option to work from home, for a huge amount of people it clearly works well, and it makes a business way more flexible, adaptable and global.\n\nBut personalities vary, and I definitely prefer being at the office in person for at least three days a week, for a few key reasons:\n\nOne, achieving similar results from home requires that the business you work for has good remote communication infrastructure. My current job does not, and the inability to talk to my director makes figuring out what I need to do take 4x longer. Within my role, the director is constantly in meetings, and I don't have an awareness of when they aren't because things constantly shift around here. I've seen other studios work far better remotely that this one, but it definitely takes that infrastructure and process to be well implemented.\n\nTwo, Social accountability. I don't have to work as hard to start a task if I have people around me. I ultimately just find myself wasting less time if I'm away from home. This extends beyond the social aspect, as I need a significant separation from home space to be productive without dragging work into my home life.\n\nThree, my office is just better laid out for all the things I need to do: If I need to run a work related errand, it's much easier to do from there, there's tools and equipment that takes up alot of space if I were to keep it at home, and generally, being away from home isolates me from alot of distraction.\n\nI dont see why we need to be so dismissive of people working in different ways, isn't that the whole point of being able to work from home in the first place?",

It's true. People that worked from home (almost all of us at my organization) had \"zero negative impact\" on their productivity. That being said... the people that slacked on their job duties while in office, doubled down to the extreme when they were left completely unsupervised at home.\n\nPersonally I think this is a management issue (Why isn't the manager auditing every employee and their workload?) but I can tell you with a 100% factual statement, there were people that straight up did not do their job, took the opportunity while working  from home to essentially watch their kids, fix up their homes, go shopping, etc.\n\nTL;DR: People that cared about their job from the start, didn't effect their productivity working from home.

            "Some mods have been allowed to get away with completely fucking over a subreddit cause they've been grandfathered into the system.  While this might seem like a good way to get fresh faces instead, these \"problem mods\" aren't being targeted specifically.  Instead, those that will be targeted are being targeted for engaging in protest - presumably to be replaced with ones that will toe the line.  Mods shouldn't be untouchable, but this isn't a good thing that **this** is the thing reddit is making an exception over in terms of removing/replacing mods.\n\n\nIts just super weird that mods can ruin their subreddit for all their subscribers cause they were in charge first and reddit has overwhelmingly been fine with considering such things as \"out if their hands\" - but immediately when there is a collective action taken to protest how the site is being run, suddenly removing/replacing mods is ok?  I get that people hate reddit mods, and I dislike many too, but I'm not cheering for this.  Frankly, while many current mods suck, I'm concerned about the type of people who would use this situation to volunteer for these positions.\n\n\nMy current plan *was* just to drop reddit on mobile once 3rd party apps go and then only drop it completely on desktop too if they get rid of old reddit.  However, if reddit goes around replacing mods en masse, I might have to fasttrack dropping it completely.  The type of people they'll be disproportionately handing mod powers to are those that specifically prioritize their desire to impose the rules (as they see fit/interpret them) above their ability to participate in action that criticizes reddit for anti-user changes.  This risks changing the makeup of the site in terms of how the rules are enforced.  While I don't like rules enforced against me just because these older mods \"were there first\" I'm even less comfortable with rules being enforced by people who are only mods cause they're essentially scabs - people who valued having mod powers over the userbase above having their own autonomy to protest management.

At least Zuckerberg gives people the freedom to say what they want as long as it's not breaking any laws or overtly racist. \n\nBut many of the authoritarian liberals want free speech restricted to the point that you can't even have philosophical debates about these issues.

They think emotionally. So they're in favor of unobjective, unfair rules.

What do those cost? I want the service I had last year, I didn’t agree to any changes!\n\nRep: I understand ma’am.

VIP Packages are an additional $49.99/month and each All Access Package is an additional $129.99/month.\n\nMe: Are you @$*#&$ kidding me?

And its unlimited access, so it really pays for itself the more time you spend on it.\n\nMe: Uh, no…Why is there a change? I refuse to pay more for the same service. Isn’t it illegal to filter access to websites?\n\nRep: Ma’am, I’m pleased to tell you that in December 2017, Ajit Pai and the FCC decided to revoke Net Neutrality rules, allowing us at Comcast to better serve you with these customized packages.

            "The fundamental problem has nothing to do with wind or natural gas, specifically. It has to do with how the ERCOT market is designed. The ERCOT market is the only deregulated power market without some sort of capacity payment (basically, a payment for existing and being able to perform if needed). Every other deregulated power market has a capacity market, which supplements the energy payments (for performance) generators receive. The lack of a capacity market (read: stable revenue) means that power plant developers are largely, though not always, unable to procure funding for a new gas plant (the key input here) without an offtake agreement with a local utility. Therefore, only renewables get developed because they have offtake agreements with utilities seeking to meet renewables goals. This occurs at the same time that coal plants (stable, base load plants) are being taken offline due to environmental costs. Furthermore, regulators do not require (nor arguably should they directly require) deicing packages on wind turbines, which makes those same turbines that run just fine in Canada unable to do so in Texas. \n\nSo essentially, this was a foreseeable problem when ERCOT reviewed and dismissed capacity markets in the early 2010s. Yes, it is also related to environmentalists pushing for the removal of coal (not a problem if there’s an offset, and frankly a good policy issue) and the lack of incentivization for new build natural gas. But, it’s poor market design at its core. Stable revenue = developer incentive. Crazy erratic market = no financing for you. \n\nThat’s also assuming you believe in deregulated power markets.

Obviously the former region has the budget and infrastructure to handle snowstorms and deep freezes of this magnitude and the latter has some of the most air conditioned cities on the planet due to the dangerous levels of heat they experience on a seasonal basis.\n\nAs far as I understand, Texas has not seen sustained sub-freezing temperatures such as this in over 100 years. This weather is unprecedented for any person alive in Texas today. I live in West Texas where 100% of my home’s power comes from wind turbines that are currently being ravaged by weather that this region hasn’t seen since decades before wind turbines were ever even dreamt of being built here.\n\nDo I wish that they were prepared for this type of once-in-a-century weather? Sure. But hindsight is 20/20 and preparation narratives are easy to talk about after an unexpected tragedy occurs. I do not blame them for not being able to handle this type of weather because it’s so out of the ordinary that no one alive in Texas today could even tell you a story about “when I was a kid, we had The Big Freeze” because it simply hasn’t happened on this magnitude here in that long.\n\nWhat is more relevant, however, is that for many here, this is simply another news article that has no bearing on day-to-day life. But for millions of Texans, it does. Real life is that our city of 100,000+ people has no running water. Many do not have electricity here. Our icy roads have never seen a snow plow in their history and the grocery stores do not have enough water.\n\nI am thankful to have power, but no water. Others in town have neither. We have scooped up snow and brought it inside to use as water for flushing or to boil so we can cook. We have traversed the icy roads to take our limited amounts of bottled water, air mattresses, and blankets to friends and neighbors. We are trying to work together to just “make it the end of the week” when warmer temps await us and we hope to have water again. \n\nMany of us will be fine in a few days, but many will not. I know of many whose ceilings have collapsed due to burst pipes. I have witnessed many near car crashes and read about other fatal ones nearby. It’s tough. It’s real.

Wind provides a quarter of it's energy and remained largely operational due to not having a single point of failure.",

After all, broadband is an ~~interstate~~ international service; Internet traffic doesn't recognize ~~state~~ country lines. It follows that only ~~the federal government~~ ICANN can set regulatory policy in this area. For if individual ~~states~~ countries like ~~California~~ the US regulate the Internet, this will directly impact citizens ~~in other states~~ across the world.",

Thus it would fall under the Commerce Clause and thereby the Supremacy Clause.\n\nSo strictly from a legal point of view, I can see his point, and it would be a really good one to make in court. California would need to prove that they can divide the Californian Internet from the rest of the American Internet without harming the wider American Internet. That's difficult, and I don't know about the idea of having the entire Internet being divided up in regulation between the states--it sounds very much not the \"open and free Internet.\"\n\nSo, whatever you think of Pai or Net Neutrality, California is not the answer here.

That's what changed. And if you think for a nanosecond that corporations won't take advantage of that to increase their profits, you are potently ignorant. The obvious retort being\n\n*\"Well, they haven't, so why not?\"*\n\nProbably because the regulations are in a state of fluctuation. ISPs know NN has public support, and if Dems assume control it will be reinstated. It's not profitable for them to restructure their system, both technically and financially, if NN will be reinstated soon. They're waiting to see what happens. And if they do feel safe that NN will remain repealed indefinitely, it still won't happen fast, because they'll want to avoid consumer backlash, even though many ISPs have a monopoly in the region they serve.\n\nAnd for anyone still confused as to whether NN is good or bad, simply Google \"Pros And Cons Of Net Neutrality\". That way you can get info for both arguments and clearly see that the pros of having NN vastly outweigh the cons.\n\nAnd [here](https://www.freepress.net/our-response/expert-analysis/explainers/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history) is a link detailing some examples of corporations taking advantage of customers before Net Neutrality rules prevented them from doing so, just to give you an idea of what corporations will do without NN rules in place.\n\nNN helps you.

            "I think people have a big misunderstanding on how the Internet is setup in the US and what the Open Internet Rules enacted in 2015 did. Quite frankly, Ajit Pai understands these aspects very well.\n\nNow people may have a problem with a municipal ISP like Comcast and think there is a monopoly. But a company like Comcast needs to partner with dozens of ISPs in order for them to offer a service better than the alternatives. They usually do this by connecting to an IXP. The IXP is incentivized to prevent ISPs connecting to it from blocking/throttling traffic. The ISPs are incentivized to connect to an IXP because it significantly reduces latency.\n\nWhat was brought up then was that Comcast was throttling Netflix in order to get them to pay them money for access. However, after the fact it was discovered as a network error by Cogent that Netflix connects to.\n\nIt also would not be in an ISPs best interest to filter traffic. They can somewhat throttle connections based on tiers, but there is a limit without more sophisticated technology. What makes the internet work is simple code working fast and efficiently. The headend processes a packet in a couple lines of code. In order to filter the traffic they would need to run hundreds of lines of code and access a database several times significantly increasing the amount of necessary calculations and making the internet unusable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow what the Open Internet Guidelines did was significantly increase the power of the FCC to regulate and censor the internet. It also added vague rules that would be difficult for a company to comply to. As a result of this Internet Infrastructure Investment was significantly reduced in the years following the implementation.\n\nWhat Pai did by reversing these guidelines is reducing the authority the FCC has to regulate and censor the internet. With current talks on capital hill about social networks doing some type of censoring. I think giving the FCC the power to act on this would have been a major stain on free speech.",

            "This need to dismantle net neutrality by Ajit Pai runs so contrast to the real American Values that his party is supposed to embody.  First and foremost this is a constitutional crisis in that the ability for cable companies and by proxy our government (you know they'll cooperate) to censor content running through their lines can easily step on citizen's First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nSecondly, if net neutrality is dismantled it gives the cable companies free reign to go crazy with fees on BOTH sides (content providers and consumers), remember 10 or so years ago when your cable bill was full of hidden charges, expect that to get MUCH MUCH worse.\n\nThird, small businesses that depend on their online presence for revenue are going to be dealt a serious, possibly bankrupting, blow to their models if they are forced to bid against large corporations for online presence.  It's very likely that this will force smaller companies into obscurity while the super corporations who already control an excess of resources will be able to benefit from lessened competition.\n\nThis whole \"demonizing\" of net neutrality by Ajit Pai's FCC is a misinformation campaign to make us complacent with giving corporations even more say in our everyday lives.  We've already seen how easy it is to influence the masses over the internet (fake news, facebook, ect), we really don't need super companies whose sole purpose is to maximize their revenue brainwashing us and bleeding us dry.  So please people, call your congressperson, let them know that a vote against net neutrality is a vote against personal freedom and liberty and very possibly financial security for the everyman.",
            "I dunno, Net Neutrality gives a federal agency (i.e. a small group of largely unaccountable bureaucrats) full regulatory control over the entire fucking internet. Doesn't seem like a good idea, unless you trust the federal government, of course.",
            "If this really does go through (or even if it doesn't), the best thing to do is start learning how to become your own Internet service provider. Especially of you are already studying computer science or IT. The core protocols that the Internet runs on are public for a reason. The issues that net neutrality blocks can also be mitigated by creating more competition in the market.\n\n ISPs are one thing that definitely should _not_ become monopolistic; they are the gatekeeper between citizens and information. Yet somehow, we have let them become that way.",
            "Just for fun. If all this shit goes sideways I still remember the days before cable tv. When we used the US Post office to mail bills with checks, read books and played board games. Some of us went outside to play with friends in person. People talked on phones and used their land lines. We didn't even have call waiting, it was an optional fee. So to all you huge greedy corporations, I lived without the internet before AND I CAN DO IT AGAIN!",

That call to do nothing only benefits the very institutions you claim to denounce. Apathy has never affected anything in a positive direction. Please don’t stand in the way of those struggling to safeguard or improve this situation.  ",
            "Here's how this is going to play out.\n\n1. The FCC does whatever they want because Pai and his crew have been bought and paid for. All the while saying, \"To hell with your comments and what you want, we manufactured enough fake comments to drown the real, and buried the evidence we ever did such a thing.\"\n2. Net Neutrality becomes gutted\n3. Cable providers begin fucking everyone over as hard as they possibly can, the gloves come off, fast lanes, access packages. The reality is, those providers have been watching us freak out about this and our theories on what would happen without net neutrality, they're going to use those ideas as their \"Playbook for making mad cash\"\n4. Customers bitch and bitch and bitch. It falls on deaf ears. Some of them cancel their Internet or try to change providers. They soon realize that if competitors are available, that they're going to fuck them over the same way.\n5. Complaints increase to FCC, they'll do nothing as long Pai is in power.\n6. Elections come around again, with any luck, the dumbasses that either didn't vote or voted for Trump because they thought \"he was going to change things\" realize how fucked up things got because of it. And they either start voting or vote differently.\n7. Someone else comes into power, FCC starts attempting to reinstate Net Neutrality because \"you saw how big of a disaster it was without it\"\n8. People get amnesia and vote for another mistake....go to step 1."

I'm available, but I'm also out of my pants and into something comfortable. \n\nThis traditional sit in your office for 8 hours is BS. Hybrid is definitely the way to go for my situation.\n\nMy commute is 7 minutes so it's ideal. I guess my point is that there is no one size fits all that works here",

            "My wife and I have both been remote since before the pandemic, and so we got in an RV and toured National Parks for 6 months while making full salaries, with no mortgage and the only commute being rolling through verdant valleys on our way to see the next great wonder of America.",

            "I think giving workers the flexibility to work from home/office when they want is really awesome.\n\nI still really enjoy coming to the office every now and then (and in my case, I often don't really have a choice), but it's also great to be able to work at home when I don't need anything from the office.\n\nFrankly having the option is fantastic and where I work it's already become the norm for the future. I hope other companies with similar structures do the same tbh.",
            "Hi! Software engineering manager at FAANG here.\n\nI told my team they can do whatever they want as far as work arrangements go; and if productivity becomes a concern we’ll evaluate the data and make choices together on how we want to respond to it down the line. \n\nFor now, enjoy the freedom you’ve earned. Y’all remained productive during this whole thing - I don’t see why that would change all of a sudden now.\n\nIf my leadership wants to come down hard on return to office politics, I’ll be shielding my peeps from it until they cave or fire me! 😁",
            "Why would I want to go back to the office? It's noisy, stuffy, and I have no reason to be there. I have maybe one conference call a day, and its a conference call regardless of me being in the office or not. I have team meetings once a week, I have no issue going in for that day.  I save drive time, I am much more comfortable, and I don't have my manager bothering me as much which hurts productivity.  \n\nBut can we seriously talk about how shitty office air quality is compared to a home office where you can open windows and turn on a fan.  The quality of air in the average office building sucks, they have harsh lighting, and it's either too hot or too cold.  The air quality and lighting had me feeling like shit every day at 3pm for years, and I just put up with it.  There isn't enough fucking oxygen in most buildings, there is tons of excess CO2, and air handlers rarely get cleaned.  It's truly a nightmare for people with Asthma, migraines, or a plethora of other diseases.",
            "There's absolutely no fucking reason why we should have to go in yet my employer has been making us do so at least once a pay period; we've yet to hear any plausible answer and they're gunning for us to come in even more.  It honestly makes no sense to me and pisses me off -- I can get out of bed and be working within 5 minutes, or it can go the following way:\n\n1. Wake up an hour earlier than if I was telecommuting\n2. Shit, shower, shave\n3. Get dressed (i.e. not throwing on sweatpants within a minute of waking up)\n4. Get stuck in traffic 90% of the time on the way to work\n5. End up arriving to work late\n6. Get interrupted multiple times by people entering my office and asking if they're interrupting me\n7. Shit on Debra's desk (optional)\n8. End shift early because I want to avoid traffic, charging time\n9. Get stuck in traffic anyway on the way home\n10. Finally get home and take an hour to settle in\n\nOh, and not to mention the money saved by not using gas and the 0% possibility of getting into one of the every day morning/evening accidents that happen causing said traffic.",

            "Currently having this argument with my company.\n\nThey claimed they would continue COVID rules until *at least* September 2021, but the fucking DAY the CDC said \"masks off,\" they threw all caution to the wind, got rid of all mask and social distancing restrictions, and tried to say everybody's gotta' \"get back to work.\"\n\nThose were their exact words. \"Back to work.\" As if we hadn't already been working.\n\nThey also claim that vaccination is mandatory, but when I asked how they're vetting people's vaccination records the same way they're entitled to do with more common vaccines, they said they can't (which is bullshit) and they \"trust their workers.\" Not enough to let us keep working from home, of course. They don't trust us THAT much.\n\nI joined the company after the pandemic had started, explicitly because I wanted a WFH situation to get *away* from a job that wouldn't allow it, so I don't actually have a physical desk to come back to. They said I should drive in and find a hoteling station (basically first-come-first-served desks where there's only one desk for every 3 employees) each morning.\n\nI'm just fucking not playing ball. I've got nowhere to \"go back\" to.",
            "Workers in the tech industry have long talked about how their jobs could be done remotely, but it just wasn't offered as an option.\n\nThe pandemic changed the status quo and proved all the excuses why they couldn't do it to be bullshit.\n\nNow workers are seeing an opening to demand it.",
            "I’m going to work so much less now that my office is requiring people back. Working from home, I don’t mind spending an extra 15 or even 30 minutes finishing up stuff, sometimes longer if I need to, because I don’t have to get in a car and drive an hour home in traffic with all the stress that entails.\n\nOnce we go back, I’ll need to leave on the dot. I have to, if I want to have any sort of life outside the office, or see my kid before bed, or have time to cook and eat dinner and get a reasonable amount of sleep.\n\nIt doesn’t make any sense… we’ve been working from home for a year and a half with the best numbers in years, but because of some outdated stereotype, I need to suffer through commuting once again…",
            "Meanwhile I work in tech and am the only person working out of the office in a company of thousands. I got special permission to come in after working from home for a year.

            "People talking bout outsourcing to foreign workers I think are wrong. .  I think it's more likely that business based in California will hire tachs in low cost of living states where salaries are lower.   Instead of paying this  IT guy 100k a year in Cali, I can pay someone in Oklahoma 60k a year and get the same quality and amount of work.    It's not  something that will happen overnight but i do think will happen once the company has the infrastructure set up to do it..\n\nJust be mindful of other consequences other than your own immediate satisfaction.",
            "My company is trying to force me back to office. Little do they know I'm leaving next month because their \"office centric culture\" is toxic as hell and I'm way happier at home. Even if I somehow got an exemption, it wouldn't last and they would blacklist me from a promotion I'm about to get. I feel like a lot of people are going to leave jobs that try to control their workers in this fashion.",
            "I don't want to go back in full time. But I do want a situation of hybrid work somehow. The last week I've had to spend a lot of time in the lab and I realized exactly how much I miss the Camaraderie, free-form brainstorming, and social interaction of in person work. Also, my apartment is too fucking small to be an office.",
            "This could also be a boom for smaller towns and rural areas as well. A lot of people (at least in Sweden) would say that they want to live in the countryside but can't because of the notion that they have to be at work.",

            "My wife’s company was very anti work from home before the pandemic. The manager over all of them was all about butts in seats. The company owns a large campus but also had huge leases all over town and they were bursting at the seems. Well the manager was fired at the start of the pandemic since they thought a major down size was going to be needed.  My wife and another employee ended up running the department.  They have been 100% WFH and will stay that way.  Some employees don’t even live in the area anymore.  They are way more productive.  It’s all about managing goals and expectations.",
            "This mentality of being in the office isn’t for the workers, its for upper management. They probably believe if productivity is similar or even increased during WFH , they will be looked at as not so relevant. Then they force people to come back to the office and are surprised when people quit.",
            "Unpopular opinion here, but I really like the social aspect of being in-person at an office. It’s just a lot more difficult to build relationships with people virtually, so I definitely prefer at least optional in-person work (maybe a few days a week or something would be nice). \n\nAs a young person who isn’t married with a family, it means a lot to me to be able to meet other people, which I just don’t get from a virtual work environment.\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify my POV, if I’m going to spend 8+ hours of my day doing something, it’s just a lot more enjoyable for me to have others around to enjoy the experience with. I’m not saying it’s impossible to socialize outside of work, but work is the majority of my day and I want to enjoy it as much as possible, not to mention i am typically exhausted after work hours regardless of in-person or virtual. \n\nI interned last summer and am about to start full time at a big tech company that usually did a lot of social events for interns and new hires before the pandemic hit (sporting events, weekly happy hours, etc...). I made the most by scheduling small meetings with people around the company, but that’s just not the same as running into them in the hallway or grabbing lunch together.",
            "I’m back office staff at a uni (Uk). We have been told no more than two days a week in the office next academic year. Campus staff / lecturers are pushing for less mass lectures, where the majority would be remote and more seminars. Makes sense especially for sciences, labs etc. Tuition fees will remain the same as the government wants the interest",
            "Who would have thought that an industry where it's incredibly important to be able to concentrate deeply on a task without interruption, might see employees not wanting to cram into open plan offices? \n\nWow such a concept!",
            "My company brags about being being global with branches and clients all over the world.  We're close enough to a major tech hub that we constantly bleed new hires to the hub that also pays more for college grads.  They used to be easier to go remote, but after IBM pulled in their people making them go to the office or they didn't have a job (forced attrition vs layoffs), my company decided to do the same thing except I don't think they ended up firing anyone.  They gave us the excuse that 'Innovation happens in the office\" and my team looked around at each other all with similar thoughts \"The open source projects that run the internet aren't built with everyone in the office...\"  \n\nMy team is spread out across the US with a few places with a few employees each, but our client is on the other side of the country from most of us, so we're mostly remote anyway.  The center I was in was all remote....no local clients, but there were several teams.  When COVID hit they were decently quick in shutting down the offices and letting us work from home.  But now that things are getting back, they're looking at pulling people back in the office but the concessions they're making to space everyone out reduces the capacity by half.  So no idea what my team will have to do.  Luckily, the commute was ten minutes each way so that's not a huge factor, but still f going into the office regularly.  \n\nI sent an email to the regional manager saying if they continued allowing full remote, we might be able to poach some talent from the tech hub nearby since we pay lower, we'd at least have something to offer since we can't match the pay.  I didn't hear anything back.",
            "Old ceo wants us all back in the building 5 days a week because their tired of being the only person in the office or only seeing around 5 or 8 people at any time? We need to have a full looking parking lot for \"appearance\" on board days? I work in IT and am more efficient at home and never see these people on the days I was even in the office..unless they came to me. Management is scrambling now because almost every department has someone who does not want to go back in at all, I know our IT department does not. Good luck finding employees who do."
